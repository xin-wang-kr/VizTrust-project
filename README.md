# Thank you for everyone's interest in VizTrust and your emails to request access to this tool. This project and I are facing a challenging time due to the NSF reduction in the US. The orignal plan to open access this tool has to be delayed due to the situation. If you would like to donate or support this work to continue, welcome to contact me at xwang314@binghamton.edu . Thanks!
